# Care-Root
Care Root is my personal project currently I’m working on, it is an E-commerce website, but its mission is to help customers purchase eco-friendly products and products that are used for charity. It will show visually how great difference their purchase can make, for example, if they purchase shampoo which is biodegradable the site will show visually that it is  Equivalent to picking two shampoo bottles from the ground. If they purchase TOM’s sneakers it is equivalent to giving one pair of shoes to kids who don’t have one. Sice is unfinished but I’m currently working on it.
